						<h3>Designing Your First Printable</h3>
						<p>To start designing your first printable, you need the right tools. Programs like Canva, Adobe Illustrator, or Procreate are great for designing passive income printables. While paid tools offer more features, free tools still allow you to create high-quality designs. The key is to use what you have and keep learning as you go.</p>
						<p>Once you’ve made your printable, make sure it’s a high-quality design. A good design will make your passive income printables valuable to your customers and encourage them to buy from you again.</p>
						<h4>Creating Printables with AI</h4>
						<p>Additionally, you may also use high-quality visuals or AI generated images.

						<h3>Making Your Passive Income Printables Stand Out</h3>
						<p>The market for passive income printables can be competitive, but with the right approach, your printables can stand out. Look at other successful sellers to see what’s popular and learn from them. But also, don’t be afraid to think outside the box and create something different that offers something new to customers.</p>
						<p>Consider making seasonal designs for your passive income printables. Many people look for printables that match holidays or seasonal trends. Offering designs like these can create a sense of urgency and make customers more likely to buy. By keeping your designs fresh and in line with trends, you’ll grow your passive income printables over time.</p>

						<h2>How Rachel Jimenez Built a $9,500/Month Business Selling Printables on Etsy</h2>
						<p>In her article, "I Earn $9,500 a Month Selling Printables I Make on Canva. Here's How I Built My 6-Figure Business," Rachel Jimenez shares how she turned a small side hustle into a full-time business. She explains how she started selling printables—digital products like planners, templates, and games—on Etsy and grew her monthly income to $9,500. Her story shows how hard work, learning from mistakes, and staying focused on customer needs can lead to success.</p>
						<p>Rachel started her journey in 2019 by taking online courses about blogging and selling printables on Etsy. At first, her sales were low, bringing in only about $50 a month. But Rachel didn’t give up. After having her second child, she decided to fully commit to her Etsy store and make it her main focus. She changed her mindset from doubting herself to believing that she could figure it out. This shift in thinking helped her keep going, even when things didn’t go as planned. By staying persistent and learning from each mistake, she eventually grew her sales.</p>
						<p>One of the biggest lessons Rachel learned was to focus on what her customers wanted. She says, “Once I started using my skills to help others solve problems and fulfill their needs, sales started to come in.” Rachel used tools like Google Trends and Pinterest to find out what people were searching for and created products that met those needs. She found that listening to customers and solving their problems was a key factor in her success.</p>
						<p>Rachel also learned that making good product listings with clear and attractive images is key to getting sales. Even if your product is great, a poor listing image can turn customers away. She spends time creating professional, eye-catching images that clearly show what her products are about.</p>
						<p>Rachel's story proves that with dedication, a positive attitude, and a focus on what customers need, you can turn a small idea into a successful business.
